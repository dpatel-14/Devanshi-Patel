    <p>
      Women Rights are Human Rights
We should be able to to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, to be educated, to own property, to vote, and to earn an equal wage.
But across the world many women and girls still face discrimation because of their gender. 
Gender inequality underpins many problems which disproportionately affect women and girls, such as domestic and sexual violence, lower pay, lack of access to education, and inadequate healthcare.
For decades women have been treated as less than we should have been and after decades of fighting for our rights we have these rights today.
But there are still so many women that donâ€™t have what we do.
